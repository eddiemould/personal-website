        <p>'The Glow' was a short film I made in my first year studying at Bournemouth Film School in 2022. For this film I designed the final poster as well as an assortment of graphical elements for the production design. These designs can be seen below.</p>

        <p>Above is the final poster for the short film. The custom typography is inspired by Sam Smith's design work for Nobuhiko Obayashi's film 'House'. The prominent visual element is a photo of the alien vessel that was designed for the film, tinted green.<br><br>Below are a series of designs I created that appear (physically) inside the film. Two posters that were posted on the outside of a cinema, and one flyer advertising the cinema.</p>
