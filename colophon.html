    <p class="page-text">Over the last few years, my time spent online has decreased and become more conscious. Maybe it was inevitable to stumble across a <a href="https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html" target="_blank">smaller web</a>. It was from this discovery that I began to write code for the first time. I found that, in a new way, I was finally getting my teeth back into design.</p><br>
    <p class="page-text">This website was built and is maintained by hand using HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. I use VS Studio Code as an editor. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages. All very grassroots.</p><br>
    <p class="page-text">The typeface is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono" target="_blank">Noto Sans Mono</a>.</p><br>
    <p class="page-text">I am still very new to this whole web design thing. If you come across something that seems broken, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@eddiemould.com">let me know</a>!</p><br>
    <p class="page-text">Thanks for visiting this space. See you around.</p><br>
    <p class="page-text">- Eddie</p><br>
